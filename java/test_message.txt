A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance, and maybe they'd be happy for a while. But February made me shiver with every paper I'd deliver. And bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step. I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride, but something touched me deep inside the day the music died. So bye bye miss American pie. Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry. And them good ol' boys were drinking whiskey and rye, singing "this will be the day that I die. This will be the day that I die." Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above if the Bible tells you so. Ah, do you believe in Rock and Roll, can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well I know that you're in love with him 'cause I saw you dancing in the gym. You'd both kicked off your shoes. Man I dig those rhythm and blues. I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck but I knew I was out of luck the day the music died.
