# HelloWorlds

This is to be a repository to test out different programming languages on different levels. The idea is that I will create programs in each different language to run one of a number of intermediate (but still hello world-esque) programming problems. These include:

1. The Fibonnaci Sequence
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. String Reversal
4. Binary Searching
5. BOGO Sorting (Maybe, I've got an idea for this one that could bring it down to insertion-sort runtime ;)

At the moment I don't know what languages I will do this in. I'll probably start with things I know and move on from there.
