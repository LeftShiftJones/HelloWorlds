# HelloWorlds

This is to be a repository to test out different programming languages on different levels. The idea is that I will create programs in each different language to run one of a number of intermediate (but still hello world-esque) programming problems. These include:

1. The Fibonnaci Sequence (recursion)
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm (graphs)
3. String Reversal (string manipulation)
4. Binary Searching (storting)
5. BOGO Sorting (Maybe, I've got an idea for this one that could bring it down to insertion-sort runtime ;)

At the moment I don't know what languages I will do this in. I'll probably start with things I know and move on from there.
